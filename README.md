# Overview

This project uses hardhat and react. It's a Multi-Signature Wallet on Kovan requiring 2 confirmations for transactions. It also leverages a chainlink price feed to get balances and submit transactions in USD.

There are tasks already available to fund your deployed wallet with LINK and small amounts of ETH.

If you'd like to increase confirmation requirements, you'll need to edit the deploy scripts, environment file (for private keys), and the frontend to match.
