# Overview

This project was developed using hardhat and react. It's a Multi-Signature Wallet on Kovan requiring 2 confirmations. It also leverages a chainlink price feed to get balances and submit transactions in USD.

If you'd like to increase confirmation requirements, you'll need to edit the deploy scripts, environment file (for private keys), and the frontend to match.
